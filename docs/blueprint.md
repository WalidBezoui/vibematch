## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant green (#00F5A0) to represent growth and connection, inspired by the brand's current aesthetic.
- Secondary color: Light cyan (#E0F7F4), a muted shade of the current #00D9E9, providing a complementary background element that adds depth without overwhelming the vibrant primary color.
- Accent color: Turquoise (#00E0C7), subtly diverging in hue from the primary color but ensuring noticeable contrast, used for interactive elements and key highlights to draw user attention.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a modern, fashionable feel.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that complements 'Poppins' for longer text blocks.
- Use material symbol outlined icons, providing a consistent and modern look.
- Maintain a clean, spacious layout with a maximum width container for readability. Incorporate rounded corners for a softer, more approachable feel.
- Subtle hover effects and transitions to provide visual feedback and enhance user engagement. The primary color's glow on hover should provide a subtle but satisfying response to user action.
