Here is a summary of all the recent updates for your commit description.

This major update completely overhauls the homepage UI/UX, fixing persistent layout bugs and implementing significant visual and copy enhancements.

Architectural Rework & Bug Fixes:

Hero Section: Permanently fixed the long-standing clipping issue where floating animated cards would get cut off. The container architecture was rebuilt to provide a proper "safe zone" for animations, ensuring they render correctly.
Feature Sections ("Pain Points"):
Re-architected the "Stop wasting money..." and "Stop chasing payments..." sections, replacing fragile absolute positioning with a robust CSS Grid layout.
This definitively solves all card overlapping and container overflow issues that caused horizontal scrollbars.
The headline text wrapping on "Stop wasting money on fake engagement" has been fixed for large screens to match the design.
Animation Restoration: Re-implemented previously broken floating animations on the feature section cards.
Visual & UX Enhancements:

Enriched Dashboard Mockup: The main hero section dashboard mockup has been transformed from an empty wireframe into a rich, data-dense preview of the application, featuring a welcome header, stat cards, an "Action Required" list, and campaign progress bars.
CTA Improvements:
Added modern arrow icons to key call-to-action buttons for better visual affordance.
Added compelling scarcity and exclusivity subtext under the main Brand and Creator CTA buttons to improve conversion.
Glow Effects: Applied a glowing gradient-text effect to key marketing phrases like "Launch", "VibeMatch", and "fake engagement" to draw user attention.
Modernized Icons: Updated the icons in the "VibeMatch Escrow" section for a more modern and beautiful aesthetic.
Trust Bar: Added "Google for Startups" to the list of trusted partners in the ecosystem section.
